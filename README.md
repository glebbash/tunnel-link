# tunnel-link: Link from any GitHub repo to your VSCode tunnel

![tunnel-link screenshot](chrome-ext/screenshot.png)

This VSCode Web extension opens or clones a GitHub repository in a tunnel when a specific folder is opened and the URL contains `?repo=...` query parameter with repo url.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to setup `tunnel-link.baseFolder` setting to point to your base folder where you want the repositories to be cloned/opened. Otherwise this extension will not do anything.

## üîó Companion `tunnel-link` extension for Chrome

You should also [install companion extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tunnel-link/mmnknemeobjjnfkcphlngcpfbimlkojb) for Chrome that will inject a link on GitHub repository page that you can point to your specific vscode.dev tunnel and base folder.

## üëÄ Example setup

Inputs:
- Your VSCode tunnel is `https://vscode.dev/tunnel/dev`
- You set `tunnel-link.baseFolder` to `/home/user/DEV`

When you open this URL in your browser:
`https://vscode.dev/tunnel/dev/home/user/DEV?repo=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode` (either via the chrome extension link or by just entering it manually):
- VSCode Web will open `/home/user/DEV` folder in the `dev` tunnel
- `tunnel-link` extension is activated because of the matching `baseFolder` and `?repo=...` query parameter is present
  - if `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode` was not cloned yet, it will be cloned into `/home/user/DEV/vscode` and opened
  - if it is already cloned, it will just be opened
